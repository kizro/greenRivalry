## GreenRivalry
GreenRivalry is a JavaScript web application for UVA's Green Rivalry initiative. Dorms compete to win prizes based on their ecoDebt score, a measure of environmental friendless based on carbon footprint. Current standings and historical data is displayed using d3.js and Chart.js, which are both linked to a static database.
