        <h1 class="heading">About Us</h1>
        <h2 class="subheading">Our Mission</h2>
        <p class="subtext">At the University of Virginia, we are on a mission to create a sustainable and eco-friendly campus environment. We believe that every small step towards energy conservation can make a significant impact on our planet's future. That's why we've introduced the "Green Rivalry: The Dorm Energy Challenge."</p>
        <h2 class="subheading">What We Do</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Promoting Sustainability:</strong> We organize and manage an exciting competition among dorms to reduce their energy consumption. This competition encourages students to embrace sustainable living practices and make a positive change in our community.<br><br></li>
            <li><strong>Tracking Progress:</strong> Our state-of-the-art monitoring systems track the energy usage of participating dorms in real-time. This data helps us create leaderboards and graphs that showcase the efforts of our dorm residents.<br><br></li>
            <li><strong>Rewarding Excellence:</strong> To incentivize sustainability, we offer substantial rewards for the dorm that excels in the competition. The winning dorm receives a generous prize of $20,000, along with the satisfaction of leading the way towards a greener future.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="subheading">Why Sustainability Matters</h2>
        <p class="subtext">We firmly believe that sustainability is not just a buzzword; it's a responsibility. By reducing energy consumption, we contribute to a cleaner environment, lower energy costs, and a healthier planet for future generations. Sustainability is at the core of our values, and we are committed to spreading awareness and action among the UVA's community.</p>
